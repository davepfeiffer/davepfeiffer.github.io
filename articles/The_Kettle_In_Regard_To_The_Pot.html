<h1 id="the-kettle-in-regard-to-the-pot">The Kettle in Regard to the Pot</h1>
<p>The kettle sat upon the stove absorbing heat in order to control the state of the water contained within. Nearby a pot was perched over a burner, boiling away. The kettle thought to itself, “What a glorious tool am I. That I can heat water with such efficiency. When my contents have been coerced into the desired state, I force the water though my finely crafted spout to release a useful scream. My custom fit handle makes it an ease for my user to pour the liquid into their desired containment devices. My construction is an economy of function–truly masterful design. My creator is surely proud. The ugly, black pot to my left is such a brutish tool in comparison. Boiling water with such a utensil would be utterly daft. I am the obvious future of water enhancing tools!”</p>
<p>After some time had passed, both the kettle and the pot rested above their heating elements rigid, charred, and empty. No human had audited the job these tools were designed to solve. The water was gradually vaporized until none could be found in its native form.</p>

<p>This post was originally a comment that I enjoyed writing for a HackerNews thread. <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18419807">1</a> I’ve edited a few things since and will post a date somewhere on this page when I freeze in a state that I’m happy with.</p>
