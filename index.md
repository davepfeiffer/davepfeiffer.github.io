Short Auto-Biography
===

I am Computer Engineer focused on embedded systems, programming languages, and development tools.

I find joy in knowing a system inside and out. For example: I wrote a [static site generator](https://github.com/FreeSoftwareTrader/FreeTraderSoftware.com) with [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a Makefile for my Internet publishing needs.

If you'd be interested in working with me or would like to hear my input, send me an email.
